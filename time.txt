 i spent 6 hours on this lab .
handl the negative argument seems simple. we only need to uvmdealloc the space.
The va below  the stack , i use an original size about process to record.
The Handler on the Handle the case in which a process passes a valid address from sbrk() to a system call
 such as read or write, but the memory for that address has not yet been allocated. The page fault happens 
in the function walkaddr ,not int  the hardware , so the fault will fall in to the trap ,we need to maintain 
it in the same manner in walkaddr.
